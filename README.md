Quincy Day – CTEC 450 Final Portfolio Project

This repository contains my final project for CTEC 450: Network and Connection Security.  
The project is a fully responsive, single-page portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, resume, and contact form.  
It also includes interactive elements such as a custom JavaScript chatbot and a QR code for mobile access.
